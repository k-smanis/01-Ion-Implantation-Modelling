# 003-Qubit-Creation-via-Ion-Implantation
This program reproduces the implantation process using a Monte Carlo algorithm which I implemented using MATLAB.
Then it simulates the implantation of millions of 3x3 ion arrays, and analyses the average interaction
of the ions based on their initial parameters, such as ion implantation energy and ion spacing.
This analysis is performed using algorithms based on bespoke mathematical models.
